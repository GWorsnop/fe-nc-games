NC-Games is an application that serves news data in a similar manner to websites such as Reddit. It serves reviews and user data to clients, and allows interaction. The purpose of the site is to replicate an online community that enables users to review and discuss board games. You can interact with the site in a number of ways, such as logging in as a user, posting reviews, adding comments, upvoting and downvoting other comments and reviews and adding a new category of board game.

## How to use the site

At the application's homepage, you will intially be sent to an About page, providing more detail about how to navigate the site and the purpose of it. From here you can use the dropdown navigation menu to navigate the site. The reviews page shows a number of reviews which can be flitered and navigated through pagination. Users can interact with selected articles by upvoting / downvoting and by posting comments, as well as posting a new review of a board game. The application has a default user logged in (tickle122), but this can be changed from the log in page, allowing you to post reviews and comments as a different user. The Categories page also shows all of the board game categories that are available, from here you can add a new category.
